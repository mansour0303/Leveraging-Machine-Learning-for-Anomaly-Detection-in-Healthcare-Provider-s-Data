    "To analyze anomaly detection using various machine learning models, I will provide a brief overview of each model's approach and effectiveness in detecting anomalies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Autoencoders**: \n",
    "   - Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct input data. They learn to compress the data into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct it. Anomalies can be detected by measuring the reconstruction error; higher errors indicate potential anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:\n",
    "   - GANs consist of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the data. Anomalies can be detected by training the GAN on normal data and identifying instances that the discriminator classifies as fake or unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Representation Models**:\n",
    "   - These models focus on transforming the input data into a feature space where anomalies can be more easily identified. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can be used to visualize data and highlight outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**:\n",
    "   - SVMs can be used for anomaly detection by training on normal data and using the decision boundary to classify new instances. The distance from the boundary can indicate how anomalous a point is; points far from the boundary are considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Clustering Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - Clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN can identify anomalies by grouping similar data points. Points that do not belong to any cluster or are in small clusters can be flagged as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
